/*
ðŸ“š Scope in C

âœ… 1. What is scope?
Scope defines the accessibility of a variable.
There are two scopes -> 
1. Global Scope -> A variable defined outside of a function called global scoped variable. We can access it from anywhere from our program.

2. Local Scope -> A variable defined inside a function called local scoped variable. We can access it only inside the function.

âœ… 2. Naming variables
If you operate with the same variable name inside and outside of a function, C will treat them as two separate variables; One available in the global scope and one available in the local scope.
